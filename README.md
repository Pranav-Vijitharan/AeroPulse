‚úÖ **Remote & Affordable Health Monitoring:**  
- Our solution is **hardware-agnostic**, meaning it can work with **any stethoscope**.  
- An **ESP32-based IoT module** captures and processes lung sounds and uploads them for AI analysis.  
- Healthcare workers can conduct **on-the-spot screenings** in rural and underserved areas, reducing dependency on expensive diagnostic tools like spirometers.  

‚úÖ **Early Intervention & Preventive Care:**  
- Patients at risk (e.g., smokers, elderly individuals, asthma sufferers) can use AeroPulse for **regular self-checkups**, detecting abnormalities **before** they become severe.  
- **Intelligent Alerts**: The system flags early signs of lung disease, prompting **timely medical consultations** and preventing complications.  

‚úÖ **Scalable & Impactful for Public Health:**  
- **Mass deployment is feasible** due to its low-cost design. A single AeroPulse unit can screen hundreds of patients daily.  
- Governments and NGOs can use AeroPulse for **large-scale health campaigns** targeting early lung disease detection in high-risk populations.  

AeroPulse aligns **perfectly** with the hackathon‚Äôs vision: it is **AI-driven, seamlessly integrates with existing medical tools, enables remote monitoring, and promotes early disease detection to prevent chronic conditions.**

## üéØ Problem Statement & Our Solution  

### The Problem:
- **Lack of Accessible Medical Equipment:** In many developing countries, up to **70% of essential medical devices fail** due to poor infrastructure, lack of training, and inadequate maintenance.
- **Early Detection Gap:** Limited access to diagnostic tools like **spirometers and pulse oximeters** results in **delayed diagnosis and treatment** of lung diseases.
- **High Healthcare Costs:** Misdiagnosis and late intervention lead to **severe cases that burden the healthcare system** and incur higher treatment costs.

### How AeroPulse Solves It:
- **AI-Driven Diagnostics:** Uses **deep learning models** to analyze breathing sounds captured by a standard stethoscope, detecting early signs of lung diseases.
- **Low-Cost & Ubiquitous:** Leverages widely available stethoscopes, augmented with an **ESP32-based hardware module**, keeping costs low.
- **Remote & Proactive:** Integrates with **mobile and wearable technologies** to enable real-time health monitoring and **early intervention**.
- **Data Augmentation & Robust Models:** Uses advanced **data augmentation techniques** (e.g., adding noise, shifting, stretching, pitch shifting) during model training to improve robustness and accuracy.

## üèó Project Structure

### 1. **model-training.ipynb**
- **Purpose:**  
  This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to building, training, and evaluating the deep learning model. It:
  - Processes respiratory sound data.
  - Extracts features using MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and mel spectrograms.
  - Implements data augmentation to simulate variations in breathing sounds.
  - Constructs a hybrid CNN-GRU network architecture to classify different lung conditions.
  - Saves the trained model weights for later deployment. (weights were hosted in the cloud)
- **Key Components:**
  - **Feature Extraction:** Code to extract MFCCs and spectrogram features.
  - **Data Augmentation:** Techniques to expand the training dataset.
  - **Model Architecture:** A multi-branch network combining convolutional and recurrent layers.
  - **Evaluation:** Performance metrics and visualizations to assess model accuracy. Model is able to hit 90% accuracy.

### 2. **hardware.ino**
- **Purpose:**  
  This Arduino sketch is designed for the ESP32-based hardware prototype. It handles:
  - **Audio Capture:** Configures the I2S peripheral to record respiratory sounds.
  - **Data Storage:** Uses SPIFFS to store the recording as a WAV file.
  - **User Interface:** Manages user interactions with an OLED display and a buzzer.
  - **Network Communication:** Connects to Wi-Fi and uploads recorded audio to the server for AI processing.
- **Key Functions:**
  - **Audio Recording & Processing:** Initialization of I2S and SPIFFS, handling recording buffers, and writing a proper WAV header.
  - **User Feedback:** Animations and audio cues (chimes, countdowns) displayed on an OLED.
  - **File Upload:** Sends recorded WAV files in chunks to the server via HTTP.

### 3. **app.py**
- **Purpose:**  
  The Flask application acts as the backend API for AeroPulse. This is being hosted in the cloud. We are using Render. It:
  - **Receives Audio Files:** Provides an endpoint (`/upload`) to accept WAV files uploaded from the ESP32 device.
  - **Preprocesses Audio Data:** Extracts audio features (MFCCs) from the uploaded file.
  - **Predicts the Condition:** Loads the pre-trained GRU model and predicts lung disease from the audio features.
  - **Serves Prediction Results:** Offers another endpoint (`/get_prediction`) for retrieving the latest prediction.
- **Key Endpoints:**
  - **`POST /upload`:** Handles file upload, feature extraction, and prediction.
  - **`GET /get_prediction`:** Returns the most recent prediction and timestamp.
  - **`GET /`:** Provides basic API status and usage information.

## üîÑ How It Works: End-to-End Flow

1. **Data Capture (hardware.ino):**
   - The user presses a button on the device.
   - The ESP32 records a 10-second audio sample using the I2S interface.
   - The recording is saved as a WAV file in SPIFFS.
   - The file is then uploaded to the AeroPulse server via an HTTP POST request.

2. **Data Processing & Prediction (app.py):**
   - The server receives the WAV file at the `/upload` endpoint.
   - Audio features are extracted using `librosa.feature.mfcc()`, ensuring consistency with the training data.
   - A pre-trained deep learning model (loaded from `GRU_Model.h5`) predicts the lung condition.
   - The prediction, along with a timestamp, is stored and made available through `/get_prediction`.

3. **Feedback & Display (hardware.ino):**
   - The ESP32 periodically polls the server for prediction results.
   - The prediction result is displayed on the OLED screen, and corresponding audio feedback is played.

## Limitations

1. We had to run the AI model on the cloud as the model was not able to be fit inside microcontrollers. When we tryed quantizing the AI model such that it works on microcontrollers, it took a hit on the accuracy and therefore we proceeded with using cloud. However, in the future we aim to run the model locally with better processors.
2. The sound captured by the mic is not very optimal as the mic captures a lot of static sound. Therefore, the outputs from the model is not correct.
